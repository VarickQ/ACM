Statement:
	You are given two strings s1[0..l1], s2[0..l2] and Q - number of queries.
	Your task is to answer next queries:
		1) 1 a i c - you should set i-th character in a-th string to c;
		2) 2 i - you should output the greatest j such that for all k (i<=k and k<i+j) s1[k] equals s2[k].
Input:
	The first line contains T - number of test cases (T<=25).
	Next T blocks contain each test.
	The first line of test contains s1.
	The second line of test contains s2.
	The third line of test contains Q.
	Next Q lines of test contain each query:
		1) 1 a i c (a is 1 or 2, 0<=i, i<length of a-th string, 'a'<=c, c<='z')
		2) 2 i (0<=i, i<l1, i<l2)
	All characters in strings are from 'a'..'z' (lowercase latin letters).
	Q <= 100000.
	l1, l2 <= 1000000.
	
Output:
	For each test output "Case t:" in a single line, where t is number of test (numbered from 1 to T).
	Then for each query "2 i" output in single line one integer j.

Example:
	input:
		1
		aaabba
		aabbaa
		7
		2 0
		2 1
		2 2
		2 3
		1 1 2 b
		2 0
		2 3
	output:
		Case 1:
		2
		1
		0
		1
		4
		1
